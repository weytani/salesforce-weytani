          <h3>Salesforce</h3>
          <p>
            Since becoming familiar with Salesforce as an admin back in late 2015, I have come to
            appreciate the platform's ability to deliver robust enterprise solutions. Salesforce has
            enabled me to work across industries both public and private, delivering solutions and
            doing truly meaningful work in helping those organizations achieve their goals. I hope
            to use this portfolio site to showcase all the ways businesses can interface with their
            data.

          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            Having graduated from the&nbsp;<a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/">Turing</a
            >&nbsp;front-end engineering program, I have become deeply familiar with Javascript's
            patterns and quirks. There is something truly rewarding in knowing how to leverage the
            power of the internet and develop web application solutions entirely in Javascript. The
            ecosystem is, staggeringly huge, and as such also enormously rewarding with the proper
            motivation. Lightning Web Components and Web Components in general, present a great
            opportunity for Salesforce to bring their front-end efforts in-line with modern web
            standards. It enables engineers like myself to deliver even better experiences to our
            clients and reuse those solutions across frameworks and platforms.

          <h3>Current Efforts</h3>
          <p>
            I'm focusing on Javascript expertise for my current role at Charles Schwab, getting back
            into Omnistudio and exploring GenAI to enhance productivity. My brother recently got
            into ArcGIS administration, so we are looking into an integration with this site. This
            portfolio site for example, will be a LWR playground, a place for me to explore all
            kinds of integrations and colaborative efforts. Everything I am currently working on can
            be browsed on my&nbsp;<a href="www.github.com/weytani">GitHub</a>. I plan to give back
            to the Salesforce community by building reusable Lightning Web Components, experimenting
            with SFDX CLI plugins and writing about my experiences on the Salesforce platform and
            beyond.
