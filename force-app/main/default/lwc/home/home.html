          <h3>Salesforce</h3>
          <p>
            Since becoming familiar with Salesforce as an admin back in late
            2015, I have come to appreciate the platform's ability to deliver
            robust enterprise solutions. Salesforce has enabled me to work
            across industries both public and private, delivering solutions and
            doing truly meaningful work in helping those organizations achieve
            their goals. This portfolio site is built using LWR on Experience
            Cloud and overtime will showcase a number of configurations and use
            cases.

          <h3>Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            Having attended the Turing.edu front-end program, I became deeply
            familiar with Javascript's patterns and quirks. There is something
            truly rewarding in knowing how to leverage the power of the internet
            and develop web application solutions entirely in Javascript. The
            ecosystem is, staggeringly huge, and as such also enormously
            rewarding with the proper motivation. Lightning Web Components and
            Web Components in general, present a great opportunity for
            Salesforce to bring their front-end efforts in-line with modern web
            standards. It enables engineers like myself to deliver even better
            experiences to our clients and reuse those solutions across
            frameworks and platforms.

          <h3>Current Efforts</h3>
          <p>
            In the short term I'm focusing on the PDII certification and
            progressing towards System Acrhitect. This portfolio site for
            example, is built using a developer org and will be a playground of
            sorts. A place for me to explore all kinds of integrations and
            colaborative efforts with my wife (who is actually an admin
            herself). Everything I am currently working on can be browsed on my
            <a href="www.github.com/weytani">GitHub</a>. I plan to give back to
            the Salesforce community by contributing to open source and writing
            about my experiences on the Salesforce platform and beyond.
